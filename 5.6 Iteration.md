# Iteration

让我们试试迭代吧。

## IntoIter

IntoIter一般是最简单的，只是包装栈的`pop`。

```rust ,ignore
pub struct IntoIter<T>(List<T>);

impl<T> List<T> {
    pub fn into_iter(self) -> IntoIter<T> {
        IntoIter(self)
    }
}

impl<T> Iterator for IntoIter<T> {
    type Item = T;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<T> {
        self.0.pop_front()
    }
}
```

但我们有一个有趣的新进展。以前链表只有一个“自然”的迭代顺序，`Deque`本质上是双向的。从前到后有什么特别的？如果有人想往另一个方向迭代呢？

其实Rust中有一个答案: `DoubleEndedIterator`. `DoubleEndedIterator`继承自 Iterator (意味着所有的DoubleEndedIterator都是Iterators)有一个方法: `next_back`。 它的方法签名和`next`一样, 但它从另一端产生元素。 DoubleEndedIterator 的语义非常符合实现Deque的Iterator。你可以前后消费元素，直到两端收敛，此时迭代器为空。

很像迭代器和next，结果发现next_back并不是DoubleEndeditor的消费者真正关心的东西。相反，这个接口最好的部分是它公开了rev方法，它将迭代器包装起来，生成一个新的迭代器，以相反的顺序生成元素。其语义相当直接：调用反向迭代器只是对下一个返回的调用。

不管怎样，因为我门的Deque提供这个API非常简单：

```rust ,ignore
impl<T> DoubleEndedIterator for IntoIter<T> {
    fn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<T> {
        self.0.pop_back()
    }
}
```

测试一下:

```rust ,ignore
#[test]
fn into_iter() {
    let mut list = List::new();
    list.push_front(1); list.push_front(2); list.push_front(3);

    let mut iter = list.into_iter();
    assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(3));
    assert_eq!(iter.next_back(), Some(1));
    assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(2));
    assert_eq!(iter.next_back(), None);
    assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);
}
```

Nice.

## Iter

Iter will be a bit less forgiving. We'll have to deal with those awful `Ref`
things again! Because of Refs, we can't store `&Node`s like we did before.
Instead, let's try to store `Ref<Node>`s:

```rust ,ignore
pub struct Iter<'a, T>(Option<Ref<'a, Node<T>>>);

impl<T> List<T> {
    pub fn iter(&self) -> Iter<T> {
        Iter(self.head.as_ref().map(|head| head.borrow()))
    }
}
```

```text
> cargo build

```

So far so good. Implementing `next` is going to be a bit hairy, but I think
it's the same basic logic as the old stack IterMut but with extra RefCell
madness:

```rust ,ignore
impl<'a, T> Iterator for Iter<'a, T> {
    type Item = Ref<'a, T>;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        self.0.take().map(|node_ref| {
            self.0 = node_ref.next.as_ref().map(|head| head.borrow());
            Ref::map(node_ref, |node| &node.elem)
        })
    }
}
```

```

Shoot.

`node_ref` doesn't live long enough. Unlike normal references, Rust doesn't let
us just split Refs up like that. The Ref we get out of `head.borrow()` is only
allowed to live as long as `node_ref`, but we end up trashing that in our
`Ref::map` call.

Coincidentally, as of the moment I am writing this, the function we want was
actually stabilized 2 days ago. That means it will be a few months before it
hits the stable release. So let's continue along with the latest nightly build:

```rust ,ignore
pub fn map_split<U, V, F>(orig: Ref<'b, T>, f: F) -> (Ref<'b, U>, Ref<'b, V>) where
    F: FnOnce(&T) -> (&U, &V),
    U: ?Sized,
    V: ?Sized,
```

Woof. Let's give it a try...

```rust ,ignore
fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
    self.0.take().map(|node_ref| {
        let (next, elem) = Ref::map_split(node_ref, |node| {
            (&node.next, &node.elem)
        });

        self.0 = next.as_ref().map(|head| head.borrow());

        elem
    })
}
```

Ergh. We need to `Ref::Map` again to get our lifetimes right. But `Ref::Map`
returns a `Ref` and we need an `Option<Ref>`, but we need to go through the
Ref to map over our Option...

**stares into distance for a long time**

    self.0.take().map(|node_ref| {
        let (next, elem) = Ref::map_split(node_ref, |node| {
            (&node.next, &node.elem)
        });

        self.0 = if next.is_some() {
            Some(Ref::map(next, |next| &**next.as_ref().unwrap()))
        } else {
            None
        };

        elem
    })
}

Oh. Right. There's multiple RefCells. The deeper we walk into the list, the more
nested we become under each RefCell. We would need to maintain, like, a stack of
Refs to represent all the outstanding loans we're holding, because if we stop
looking at an element we need to decrement the borrow-count on every RefCell that
comes before it.................

I don't think there's anything we can do here. It's a dead end. Let's try
getting out of the RefCells.

What about our `Rc`s. Who said we even needed to store references?
Why can't we just Clone the whole Rc to get a nice owning handle into the middle
of the list?

```rust
pub struct Iter<T>(Option<Rc<Node<T>>>);

impl<T> List<T> {
    pub fn iter(&self) -> Iter<T> {
        Iter(self.head.as_ref().map(|head| head.clone()))
    }
}

impl<T> Iterator for Iter<T> {
    type Item =
```

Uh... Wait what do we return now? `&T`? `Ref<T>`?

No, none of those work... our Iter doesn't have a lifetime anymore! Both `&T`
and `Ref<T>` require us to declare some lifetime up front before we get into
`next`. But anything we manage to get out of our Rc would be borrowing the
Iterator... brain... hurt... aaaaaahhhhhh

Maybe we can... map... the Rc... to get an `Rc<T>`? Is that a thing? Rc's docs
don't seem to have anything like that. Actually someone made [a crate][own-ref]
that lets you do that.

But wait, even if we do *that* then we've got an even bigger problem: the
dreaded spectre of iterator invalidation. Previously we've been totally immune
to iterator invalidation, because the Iter borrowed the list, leaving it totally
immutable. However if our Iter was yielding Rcs, they wouldn't borrow the list
at all! That means people can start calling `push` and `pop` on the list while
they hold pointers into it!

Oh lord, what will that do?!

Well, pushing is actually fine. We've got a view into some sub-range of the
list, and the list will just grow beyond our sights. No biggie.

However `pop` is another story. If they're popping elements outside of our
range, it should *still* be fine. We can't see those nodes so nothing will
happen. However if they try to pop off the node we're pointing at... everything
will blow up! In particular when they go to `unwrap` the result of the
`try_unwrap`, it will actually fail, and the whole program will panic.

That's actually pretty cool. We can get tons of interior owning pointers into
the list and mutate it at the same time *and it will just work* until they
try to remove the nodes that we're pointing at. And even then we don't get
dangling pointers or anything, the program will deterministically panic!

But having to deal with iterator invalidation on top of mapping Rcs just
seems... bad. `Rc<RefCell>` has really truly finally failed us. Interestingly,
we've experienced an inversion of the persistent stack case. Where the
persistent stack struggled to ever reclaim ownership of the data but could get
references all day every day, our list had no problem gaining ownership, but
really struggled to loan our references.

Although to be fair, most of our struggles revolved around wanting to hide the
implementation details and have a decent API. We *could* do everything fine
if we wanted to just pass around Nodes all over the place.

Heck, we could make multiple concurrent IterMuts that were runtime checked to
not be mutable accessing the same element!

Really, this design is more appropriate for an internal data structure that
never makes it out to consumers of the API. Interior mutability is great for
writing safe *applications*. Not so much safe *libraries*.

Anyway, that's me giving up on Iter and IterMut. We could do them, but *ugh*.
