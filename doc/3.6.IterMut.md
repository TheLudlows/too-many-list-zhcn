# IterMut

说实话IterMut很狂疯狂，说起来似乎很荒唐。 当然它与Iter相同！

从语义上说，共享和可变引用的性质意味着

Semantically, yes, but the nature of shared and mutable references means
that Iter is "trivial" while IterMut is Legit Wizard Magic.

关键思路来自我们对Iter 的实现：

```rust ,ignore
impl<'a, T> Iterator for Iter<'a, T> {
    type Item = &'a T;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> { /* stuff */ }
}
```

可以将其去糖化：

```rust ,ignore
impl<'a, T> Iterator for Iter<'a, T> {
    type Item = &'a T;

    fn next<'b>(&'b mut self) -> Option<&'a T> { /* stuff */ }
}
```

`next`的签名中输入和输出的生命周期竟然没有联系。我们为什么要在乎？ 这意味着我们可以无条件地反复调用`next`！


```rust ,ignore
let mut list = List::new();
list.push(1); list.push(2); list.push(3);

let mut iter = list.iter();
let x = iter.next().unwrap();
let y = iter.next().unwrap();
let z = iter.next().unwrap();
```

酷！

对于共享引用，这绝对没有问题，因为你可以同时拥有多个引用。但是，可变引用不能并存。它们是排他的性质。

最终结果是，使用安全的代码编写IterMut尤其困难（我们还没有深入了解那意味着什么……），实际上，IterMut可以完全安全地用于许多结构！

```rust ,ignore
pub struct IterMut<'a, T> {
    next: Option<&'a mut Node<T>>,
}

impl<T> List<T> {
    pub fn iter_mut(&self) -> IterMut<'_, T> {
        IterMut { next: self.head.as_deref_mut() }
    }
}

impl<'a, T> Iterator for IterMut<'a, T> {
    type Item = &'a mut T;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        self.next.map(|node| {
            self.next = node.next.as_deref_mut();
            &mut node.elem
        })
    }
}
```

Ok looks like we've got two different errors here. The first one looks really clear
though, it even tells us how to fix it! You can't upgrade a shared reference to a mutable
one, so `iter_mut` needs to take `&mut self`. Just a silly copy-paste error.

```rust ,ignore
pub fn iter_mut(&mut self) -> IterMut<'_, T> {
    IterMut { next: self.head.as_deref_mut() }
}
```

What about the other one?

Oops! I actually accidentally made an error when writing the `iter` impl in
the previous section, and we were just getting lucky that it worked!

We have just had our first run in with the magic of Copy. When we introduced [ownership][ownership] we
said that when you move stuff, you can't use it anymore. For some types, this
makes perfect sense. Our good friend Box manages an allocation on the heap for
us, and we certainly don't want two pieces of code to think that they need to
free its memory.

However for other types this is *garbage*. Integers have no
ownership semantics; they're just meaningless numbers! This is why integers are
marked as Copy. Copy types are known to be perfectly copyable by a bitwise copy.
As such, they have a super power: when moved, the old value *is* still usable.
As a consequence, you can even move a Copy type out of a reference without
replacement!

All numeric primitives in rust (i32, u64, bool, f32, char, etc...) are Copy.
You can also declare any user-defined type to be Copy as well, as long as
all its components are Copy.

Critically to why this code was working, shared references are also Copy!
Because `&` is copy, `Option<&>` is *also* Copy. So when we did `self.next.map` it
was fine because the Option was just copied. Now we can't do that, because
`&mut` isn't Copy (if you copied an &mut, you'd have two &mut's to the same
location in memory, which is forbidden). Instead, we should properly `take`
the Option to get it.


```rust ,ignore
fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
    self.next.take().map(|node| {
        self.next = node.next.as_deref_mut();
        &mut node.elem
    })
}
```

Uh... wow. Holy shit! IterMut Just Works!

Let's test this:


```rust ,ignore
#[test]
fn iter_mut() {
    let mut list = List::new();
    list.push(1); list.push(2); list.push(3);

    let mut iter = list.iter_mut();
    assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&mut 3));
    assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&mut 2));
    assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&mut 1));
}
```

```

Yep. It works.

Holy shit.

What.

Ok I mean it actually *is* supposed to work, but there's usually something
stupid that gets in the way! Let's be clear here:

We have just implemented a piece of code that takes a singly-linked list, and
returns a mutable reference to every single element in the list at most once.
And it's statically verified to do that. And it's totally safe. And we didn't
have to do anything wild.

That's kind of a big deal, if you ask me. There are a couple reasons why
this works:

* We `take` the `Option<&mut>` so we have exclusive access to the mutable
  reference. No need to worry about someone looking at it again.
* Rust understands that it's ok to shard a mutable reference into the subfields
  of the pointed-to struct, because there's no way to "go back up", and they're
  definitely disjoint.

It turns out that you can apply this basic logic to get a safe IterMut for an
array or a tree as well! You can even make the iterator DoubleEnded, so that
you can consume the iterator from the front *and* the back at once! Woah!
